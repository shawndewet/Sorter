# Sorter

A console app that sorts a provided single-line input string.

It converts all characters to lower case, and ignores all punctuation.

It makes use of the InsertionSort algorithm, which I've found to be the quickest (by using a stopwatch to count the number of ticks of different sort algorithms).
